# Categories 🏷️

## Overview

├── Restaurants
├── Delivery
└── Bakery

Transportation

└── Car Maintenance
```

2. An icon library will be displayed
3. Use search to find icons (e.g., "food", "car", "home")
4. Click the desired icon

## Best Practices ✨

### Recommended Structure

**Don't create too many categories**. Too many categories make analysis difficult. A structure of 8-12 main categories is sufficient for most people.

**Example of a balanced structure**:

```
Income
├── Salary
├── Freelance
├── Investments
└── Other Income

Expenses
├── Housing
├── Food
├── Transportation
├── Health
├── Entertainment
├── Education
└── Other

Transfers
└── Between Accounts
```

### Consistent Categorization

- Define clear rules for each category
- Example: "Food" is for consumed food, "Groceries" can include cleaning supplies
- Follow your own rules consistently

## Use in Reports 📊

Categories are fundamental for reports:

### Spending by Category

The **Spending by Category** report shows:
- How much you spent in each category
- Percentage of total
- Comparison between periods

### Analysis

With good categorization, you can answer:

- "How much do I spend on food per month?"
- "Have my transportation expenses increased?"
- "Which category represents the largest part of my expenses?"

## Changing Category of Multiple Transactions

If you need to recategorize several transactions:

1. Select multiple transactions in the transaction list by holding Shift or Ctrl
2. Open the Edit All menu
3. Check the option to change the category and choose the new category

This is useful when:
- You reorganized your categories
- You realized you categorized incorrectly
- You want to merge several categories
