- Wealth evolution chart

## Statistics 📈

### What It Shows

Metrics calculated on your data:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Median Spending** | Typical monthly expense (less affected by outliers) |
| **Average Spending** | Average monthly expense |
| **Wealth Coverage** | How many months your assets cover |
| **Savings Rate** | Percentage of income you save |

### Wealth Coverage

This indicator answers: "If I stopped earning money today, for how many months would my wealth sustain me?"

**Calculation**: `Total Wealth ÷ Median Monthly Expenses`

**Example**:
- Wealth: $50,000
- Median expenses: $5,000/month
- Coverage: 10 months

After recording more than two years of transactions, Valt can show your personal inflation, with your current expenses from the last 12 months vs. the previous period. Valt will also show these expenses in sats, often demonstrating how fiat currency loses value while bitcoin preserves your purchasing power (unless you're in a sad bear market!).
