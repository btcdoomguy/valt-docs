# Valt - Personal Finance for Bitcoiners 🟠

Welcome to the official documentation for **Valt**, the personal finance app for those who use Bitcoin as a unit of account.

## What is Valt? 💡

Valt is a free and open-source desktop application that lets you manage your personal finances with a unique perspective: **see all your wealth in Bitcoin terms**.

Unlike traditional apps that only show values in fiat currency, Valt automatically converts all your transactions to satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), allowing you to understand the true opportunity cost of your financial decisions.

## Why Use Valt? 🎯

### 🔍 Bitcoin Perspective

Imagine you bought an iPhone in 2019 for $800. With Valt, you can see that this amount, if converted to Bitcoin at that time, would be worth approximately $6,000 today. This perspective completely changes how you analyze your spending.

### 🔒 Total Privacy

Your financial data is stored **locally** on your computer, protected by password. There's no cloud, no external servers, no third parties with access to your information.

### 📊 Average Price Calculation

Valt automatically calculates your **average acquisition price** following desired rules, making it easier to manage your portfolio and financial reports for your declared stack.

### 💻 Cross-Platform

Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
